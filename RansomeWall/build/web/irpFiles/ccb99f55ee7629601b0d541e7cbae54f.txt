Secure search techniques over encrypted cloud data allow an authorized user to query data files of interest by submitting
encrypted query keywords to the cloud server in a privacy-preserving manner. However, in practice, the returned query results may
be incorrect or incomplete in the dishonest cloud environment. For example, the cloud server may intentionally omit some qualified
results to save computational resources and communication overhead. Thus, a well-functioning secure query system should provide a
query results verification mechanism that allows the data user to verify results. In this paper, we design a secure, easily integrated, and
fine-grained query results verification mechanism, by which, given an encrypted query results set, the query user not only can verify
the correctness of each data file in the set but also can further check how many or which qualified data files are not returned if the set is
incomplete before decryption. The verification scheme is loose-coupling to concrete secure search techniques and can be very easily
integrated into any secure query scheme. We achieve the goal by constructing secure verification object for encrypted cloud data.
Furthermore, a short signature technique with extremely small storage cost is proposed to guarantee the authenticity of verification
object and a verification object request technique is presented to allow the query user to securely obtain the desired verification object.
Performance evaluation shows that the proposed schemes are practical and efficient
